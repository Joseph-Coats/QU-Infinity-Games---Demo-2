This is a demo of classic memory cards. The program was developed using Eclipse IDE, and its purpose is to use the Graphics2D class to apply color to overlapping grey images.

Just wait for the timer in the top left, and then you can click on the flipped cards!

Installation:
The game uses default project settings and use the "File Setup" image as a guide to appropriately place rescources.
